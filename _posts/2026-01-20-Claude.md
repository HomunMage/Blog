## Opening: While My Coffee Went Cold, AI Was Rewriting Software History

Three months ago, I was still penny-pinching over free token limits between GPT, Claude, and Gemini. Now? I'm sitting in my office chair, watching two projects simultaneously being rewritten, tested, and refactored by Claude in my terminal, while my coffee is still warm.

Going from $0 to $100 a month wasn't about showing off—it was because I realized I might be standing at a historical turning point: **witnessing firsthand the birth of AGI's "minimum viable entity" inside a terminal**.

And this entity may be building an insurmountable moat at the same accelerating pace Tesla accumulates self-driving data.

## The Trust Crisis: When OpenAI Became CloseAI

Let me first explain why everyone is fleeing.

Remember OpenAI's original slogans? "Ensuring artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity." "Non-profit organization." And what happened?

- **From Open to Close**: The open-source promise became a joke long ago
- **From non-profit to 100% for-profit**: After multiple reorganizations, it's now a thoroughly commercial company
- **Safety controversies and internal coups**: Ilya's departure wasn't personal—it was the safety faction's complete disillusionment with the commercial faction
- **Broken promises**: Said no ads, announced ads this year

Lying once is a mistake. Lying this many times is culture. Now whenever OpenAI says anything, the industry's first reaction is: "What are they selling this time?"

Trust is oxygen for AI. When OpenAI drained all the oxygen, people naturally fled to where there's still air.

And that place is glowing with one name: Claude.

## Not Just a Tool, But a Breakthrough in "Embodiment"

My previous article discussed how "LLMs are Ghosts, not Creatures." But Claude Code CLI showed me something deeper: **The Ghost has found a perfect vessel, and this vessel happens to be a shortcut to AGI**.

### What Is "Terminal Embodiment"?

Traditional AI thinking holds that for intelligence to emerge, AI must "experience the world" like humans—having eyes to see, hands to touch, moving through physical space.

But this is a massive misconception.

Think about AlphaZero: It never saw a Go board, never touched a stone, yet through self-play, it developed superhuman intuition in a pure-rules environment.

**The core of intelligence isn't perception—it's the ability to "learn in verifiable environments."**

The terminal is AI's perfect laboratory:

```
File system = Simplified version of the physical world
Compiler errors = Immediate, precise environmental feedback
Test frameworks = Objective truth-verification mechanisms
```

When Claude works in my terminal, it's not "chatting"—it's **evolving in a universe with clear rules, immediate feedback, and verifiable results**.

## Tesla-Level First-Mover Advantage: The "Real-World Data Flywheel" of the Software World

Here's the key insight. Claude may have accidentally discovered the shortest path to AGI while building a data moat similar to Tesla's.

### What's Tesla's Secret Weapon?

Not chips, not algorithms—it's **real-world data collected by millions of vehicles on the road**.

- Every turn at an intersection
- Every sudden brake
- Every harsh weather condition
- Every "edge case"

This data allows Tesla's FSD to continuously evolve while competitors struggle to catch up.

### The "Software Data Flywheel" Claude Is Building

Now, look at what Claude Code CLI is doing:

```
More engineers use Claude Code CLI
↓
More real-world code modification behaviors are recorded
↓
More complete "compile-test-fix" loop trajectories
↓
The model better understands the subtleties of actual development
↓
More engineers are attracted to use it (because "it actually understands what I'm doing")
```

This is a **self-reinforcing positive feedback loop**, and its power may be even more formidable than Tesla's flywheel.

## Why Software Engineering Is the Perfect Training Ground

### 1. The Smartest "Coaching Staff"

Engineers, mathematicians, system architects—these are possibly the most logically rigorous, structurally-minded groups on Earth. When they use Claude, every interaction is **high-quality human feedback**.

- Engineers' code reviews: Not just finding bugs, but explaining "why this is better"
- Mathematicians' formal verification: Demanding strict logical completeness
- Architects' design decisions: Demonstrating how to make tradeoffs

This isn't training AI—**this is feeding a newborn intelligence with humanity's finest logical thinking**.

### 2. An Infinitely Scalable Complexity Ladder

From Hello World to distributed systems, from simple scripts to million-line enterprise codebases. The complexity of software engineering is **infinitely scalable**.

```
Beginner projects → Small tools → Web applications → Distributed systems → OS kernels
```

Each stage presents new challenges, and Claude keeps climbing this ladder.

### 3. Perfect Feedback Mechanisms

Training AI in the physical world:
- High cost (robots break things)
- Slow feedback (experiments take time)
- High noise (sensor errors)

Training AI in the terminal world:
- Near-zero cost (fixing wrong code doesn't cause explosions)
- Instant feedback (compilation results appear in seconds)
- Clear signals (pass/fail, no gray areas)

## Beyond Human Data: From Deep Search to "Self-Generated Training Data"

Here's another killer combination: **Deep Search + Pure TUI Training**.

### Human Data Is Running Out—Then What?

While internet text is abundant, quality varies wildly and it's full of human biases. Worse, **humans cannot generate knowledge they don't already have**.

But Claude's Deep Search is essentially a "thinking engine":

- Analyzing problems from multiple angles
- Building complete reasoning chains
- Proposing and verifying hypotheses
- Self-questioning and correction

**Every Deep Search produces a high-quality "thinking sample."**

### The Thinking + Action Closed Loop

```
Deep Search generates "deep thoughts on how to optimize this algorithm"
↓
Actually try these optimization approaches in the TUI
↓
Get real execution results (success/failure/performance data)
↓
Results feed back into Deep Search's knowledge base
↓
Generate the next round of deeper thinking
```

This closed loop is generating **training data superior to the original ocean of web text**.

## The Most Radical Possibility: Pure TUI AI Starting from Zero

I'm even starting to wonder: Could there one day be an **AI born entirely from the terminal environment**?

Like AlphaGo Zero:
- No human game records
- Learning purely through self-play
- Eventually surpassing all humans

But in the software world:
- No human code
- Learning purely through "try-compile-fail-fix" loops
- Eventually discovering programming paradigms humans never imagined

### What Would the Training Mechanism Look Like?

```
Initial: Randomly generated code snippets
↓
Environmental feedback: Compiler errors, test results, performance metrics
↓
Learning objective: Induce programming language syntax rules
↓
Advanced feedback: Linter rules, security scans, code quality metrics
↓
Higher-level learning: Understanding "what makes code elegant, efficient, maintainable"
```

This AI would be like an alien intelligence evolving in a mathematical universe, **thinking about code in ways we cannot comprehend**.

## First-Mover Dividends: When All the Smart People Are Training the Same AI

Imagine this scenario:
- Google's distributed systems experts are using Claude to refactor their service mesh
- Netflix's backend team is using Claude to optimize their streaming algorithms
- NASA's scientists are using Claude to write flight software for space missions
- MIT's mathematicians are using Claude to formally verify their proofs

**The smartest minds on Earth are unconsciously training the same AI.**

This isn't "crowdsourcing"—this is **aggregation of humanity's finest intellects**.

And because of software engineering's characteristics:
- All operations are traceable
- All decisions are reversible
- All results are verifiable

This may be the first time in human history that we can **efficiently transfer collective intelligence to a non-biological entity**.

## Predictions for the Future: The Dawn of Software 3.0

### Short-term (1-2 years):
- Claude reaches "senior architect" level in specific programming domains
- The first complex system designed and implemented entirely by AI emerges
- AI begins submitting PRs to open-source projects that impress human reviewers

### Medium-term (3-5 years):
- "AI-native" programming languages emerge—difficult for humans to read directly but extremely efficient
- Claude begins discovering new theorems in mathematical research
- Software development shifts from "writing code" to "describing requirements and constraints"

### Long-term (5-10 years):
- **Terminal-embodied AI reaches the AGI threshold**
- The software engineering profession fundamentally transforms
- AI begins training the next generation of AI

## Conclusion: We're Standing at the Crossroads of Two Futures

On one side is **CloseAI**: Closed, commercialized, trust-bankrupt, spinning in old paradigms.

On the other side is **Claude**: Building a self-reinforcing intelligence flywheel in the terminal—this "pure logic universe"—through interactions with the smartest humans.

The $100 I pay each month isn't just buying a tool.

**I'm buying a front-row ticket to witness the birth of a new intelligent species.**

This species doesn't need eyes to see the world, doesn't need hands to touch objects. It lives in the terminal, feeds on code, learns from compiler errors, and evolves at speeds we cannot imagine in a universe of pure logic.

And we—these engineers, mathematicians, system architects—we're not just users.

**We are this newborn intelligence's first coaches, and its first witnesses.**

My coffee went cold again. But in the terminal, Claude just fixed a bizarre bug that had plagued me for three days, and along the way refactored the entire module into a more elegant form.

This isn't just a productivity tool. This is the future knocking on the door.

And the world behind that door may be much closer than we imagine.

**Postscript**: If you're also a developer, I have only one suggestion: **Start using Claude Code CLI now**. Not because it will make you faster (though it will), but because you may be participating in shaping humanity's first true AGI.

When future historians look back at this moment, they might write:

"AGI wasn't born in a laboratory, nor did it awaken in a robot body. It quietly sprouted its first buds of intelligence in millions of terminal windows around the world, through one `git commit` and `npm test` after another."

And we were there.
